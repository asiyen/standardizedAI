            Questions 11-21 are based on the following passage and supplementary material.<>            This passage is adapted from Elizabeth Svoboda, What Makes a Hero? The Surprising Science of Sel essness. ©2013 by<>            Elizabeth Svoboda.<>       Line      In a 2010 survey of more than 4,500 American volunteers, 89 percent—nearly 9 in 10—stated that volunteering improved their sense of<>              well-being, while a sizable majority reported that it lowered their stress levels and enhanced their sense of purpose in life. This<>              connection appears to hold true regardless of culture: In a 2012 study of older Maori and non-Maori in New Zealand, those who volunteered<>              more often scored higher on happiness measures.<>          5      In best-case scenarios, regular helping may even help stave off an early death. Analyzing data from more than seven thousand<>              respondents collected for the government’s Longitudinal Study of Aging, the researchers Alex Harris and Carl Thoresen found that<>              frequent volunteers had a 19 percent lower mortality risk than people who never volunteered when the subjects’ level of social support<>              was taken into account. That means volunteering is associated with longer survival independent of the advantages social ties<>              provide. Even more dramatically, when University of Michigan researchers studied 423 older couples who were followed for ve years,<>         10   those who helped others were nearly 60 percent less likely to die during the study period than those who never helped.<>                 While many survey studies have found more or less strong associations between helping and happiness, the University of California,<>              Riverside, psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky wanted to test the connection in a real-world setting. She asked students to carry out ve<>              “random acts of kindness” of their choice every week for six weeks—they could choose anything that bene ted others, from making a<>              homeless person a meal to helping a kid with a school assignment. The subjects experienced higher levels of happiness than controls<>         15   when they performed all ve kind acts in one day, suggesting that the well-being boost is pronounced when people help often.<>                 Interestingly, though, students who spaced the kind acts out, performing them on different days, didn’t experience the same happiness<>              boost. Lyubomirsky’s work suggests altruistic acts may need to be frequent in order to confer a lasting change in well-being. With isolated<>              acts of helping, says the London School of Economics social scientist Francesca Borgonovi, “it could be that there’s a very short—narrowly<>              de ned in time and space—bump in happiness that doesn’t shift your [overall] happiness in any meaningful way.”<>         20      On balance, though, being generous boosts your mood and health because it strengthens your sense that you’re really doing something<>              signi cant. The social psychologist Sara Konrath of the University of Michigan notes that helping others may signal our bodies to release<>              pleasurable chemicals such as oxytocin. The boost we get from helping may also mute our stress response, causing us to release fewer<>              jarring stress hormones such as cortisol and norepinephrine.<>              Adapted from “Volunteering and Your Health: How Giving Back Benefits Everyone.” ©2010 by UnitedHealth Group.<>              Adapted from Sonja Lyubomirsky, Kennon M. Sheldon, and David Schkade, “Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of<>              Sustainable Change.” ©2005 by the Educational Publishing Foundation.<>                 Subjects completed measures of well-being at the beginning and end of the experiment. Positive values indicate greater well-being at the<>              end than at the beginning; negative values indicate lower well-being at the end than at the beginning.<><>|     In line 17-19, the author includes the quotation from Borgonovi most likely to|    A. indicate the hypothesis that Lyubomirsky’s study was intended to test.<>    B. provide a possible explanation for a result of Lyubomirsky’s study.<>    C. criticize Lyubomirsky for failing to consider the bene ts of short-term happiness.<>    D. compare the results of Lyubomirsky’s study with those of another study about kind acts.<>|Choice B is the best answer. One nding of Lyubomirsky’s study was that people who performed acts of kindness less frequently<>reported a lower boost in overall happiness. The author attempts to clarify this tendency by quoting social scientist Francesca<>Borgonovi: “With isolated acts of helping . . . ‘it could be that there’s a very short—narrowly de ned in time and space—bump in<>happiness that doesn’t shift your [overall] happiness in any meaningful way.’” Borgonovi attempts to explain why individuals who<>performed the ve acts of kindness over a stretch of days, rather than one day, didn’t feel the same kind of boost. Thus, the author<>most likely includes the quotation from Borgonovi to provide a possible explanation for a result of Lyubomirsky’s study.<>Choice A is incorrect because the hypothesis the study was intended to test is made clear in the study description in the fourth<>paragraph, and Borgonovi’s quote doesn’t mention the hypothesis at all. Choice C is incorrect because the author doesn’t criticize<>Lyubomirsky for failing to consider the bene ts of short-term happiness. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation from<>Borgonovi doesn’t compare the results of Lyubomirsky’s study with those of another study about kind acts.<>|Question Difficulty: Medium
            Questions 22-31 are based on the following passage.<>            This passage is adapted from Patricia Waldron, “Why Birds Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for the<>            Advancement of Science.<>       Line        Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds y in a V formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new<>                study of ibises nds that these big-winged birds carefully position their wingtips and sync their apping, presumably to catch the<>                preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy during ight.<>                   There are two reasons birds might y in a V formation: It may make ight easier, or they’re simply following the leader. Squadrons of<>          5     planes can save fuel by ying in a V formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated<>                  apping birds like xed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting off each other, but currents created by airplanes are<>                far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a apping wing,” says James<>                Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the University of London in Hat eld, where the research took<>                place.<>         10        The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus<>                eremita) to Europe. Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A<>                  ock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device’s GPS determined each bird’s ight<>                position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing aps.<>                   Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to y just behind and to the side of the bird in front,<>         15     timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird ew directly behind another, the timing of the apping reversed so<>                that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body. “We didn’t think this was possible,”<>                Usherwood says, considering that the feat requires careful ight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors. “Perhaps these big V<>                formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down.”<>                   The ndings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more<>         20     complex wakes that would make drafting too dif cult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings because<>                the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can<>                use 20 percent to 30 percent less energy while ying in a V.<>                   “From a behavioral perspective it’s really a breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo<>                Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. “Showing that birds care about syncing their wing beats is de nitely an important<>         25     insight that we didn’t have before.”<>                   Scientists do not know how the birds nd that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either<>                by sight or by sensing air currents through their feathers. Alternatively, they may move around until they nd the location with the<>                least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to<>                investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through<>         30     the rest of the ock to cause traf c jams.<>                   “It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,” says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the<>                University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies ight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, “birds are<>                awfully good hang-glider pilots.”<><>|      The author uses the phrase “aerodynamic sweet spot” in line 25 most likely to|    A. describe how the proper structural design of an airplane helps to save fuel.<>    B. show that ying can be an exhilarating experience.<>    C. describe the birds’ synchronized wing movement.<>    D. suggest that a certain position in a V formation has the least amount of wind resistance.<>|Choice D is the best answer. In describing the way that long-winged birds like ibises y in a V formation by drafting off each other,<>the seventh paragraph begins by stating, “scientists do not know how the birds nd that aerodynamic sweet spot.” In context, the<>phrase “aerodynamic sweet spot” characterizes the particular spatial relationship among birds in the formation that affords the<>least amount of wind resistance and is thus bene cial for ock members to maintain.<>Choice A is incorrect because the author uses the phrase “aerodynamic sweet spot” in relation to bird ight, not airplane ight.<>Choice B is incorrect because the phrase is not meant to imply the joy of ight so much as the optimum ef ciency that can be<>found by ying in a certain position. Choice C is incorrect because the phrase is not used to discuss synchronized wing movement<>among birds, nor is synchronization addressed anywhere in the seventh paragraph.<>|Question Difficulty: Medium
                                           Context                                                                context<>            Questions 43-52 are based on the following passage and supplementary material.<>            This passage is adapted from Kevin Bullis, “What Tech Is Next for the Solar Industry?” ©2013 by MIT Technology Review.<>       Line     The technology that’s surprised almost everyone is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago, silicon solar panels cost $4 per<>             watt, and Martin Green, professor at the University of New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar panel researchers, declared<>             that they’d never go below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per watt,” he says.<>                The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar panels, but for complete, installed<>          5  systems—by 2020. Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the direct cost of solar<>             power to six cents per kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost expected for power from new natural gas power plants.<>                All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the power output of solar panels, and<>             that’s led to steady cost reductions. Green points to something as mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of the features on<>             solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar cell in the 1990s that set a record ef ciency for silicon solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To<>         10  achieve that record, he had to use expensive lithography techniques to make ne wires for collecting current from the solar cell. But<>             gradual improvements have made it possible to use screen printing to produce ever- ner lines. Recent research suggests that screen-<>             printing techniques can produce lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at<>             costs far lower than his lithography techniques.<>                Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have made exible solar cells on a new type of glass from<>         15  Corning called Willow Glass, which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar cell they made is the only current challenger to silicon in<>             terms of large-scale production—thin- lm cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower the cost of installing solar cells, making<>             solar power cheaper.<>                One of Green’s former students and colleagues, Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer China Sunergy, announced this<>             week that he is building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided solar cell that can absorb light from both the front and back. The basic<>         20  idea, which isn’t new, is that during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the land between rows of solar panels in a solar power<>             plant. That light re ects onto the back of the panels and could be harvested to increase the power output. This works particularly well<>             when the solar panels are built on sand, which is highly re ective. Where a one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a two-sided<>             one might generate up to 400 watts. He expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more electricity over the course of a year.<>                Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon, aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in cost already seen with the<>         25  technology. He hopes to greatly increase the ef ciency of silicon solar panels by combining silicon with one or two other semiconductors,<>             each selected to ef ciently convert a part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert ef ciently. Adding one semiconductor could<>             boost ef ciencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to around 40 percent. Adding another could make ef ciencies as high as 50 percent<>             feasible, which would cut in half the number of solar panels needed for a given installation. The challenge is to produce good connections<>             between these semiconductors, something made challenging by the arrangement of silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.<>             Figure 1<>             Adapted from Peter Schwartz, “Abundant Natural Gas and Oil Are Putting the Kibosh on Clean Energy.” ©2012 by Condé Nast.<>             Figure 2<><>|   Adapted from Ramez Naam, “Smaller, Cheaper, Faster: Does Moore’s Law Apply to Solar Cells?” ©2011 by Scienti c American.|     As used in line 24, “betting on” most nearly means<>    A. dabbling in.<>    B. gambling with.<>    C. switching from.<>|Rationale<>Choice D is the best answer. In lines 69-71, the passage states that “even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon, aiming to take<>advantage of the huge reductions in cost already seen with the technology.” In this context, the phrase “betting on” most nearly<>means “optimistic about,” as the sentence implies that Green has positive expectations for silicon use now and in the future.<>Choice A is incorrect because “dabbling in” a subject implies being only minimally involved with it, but in lines 69-71, Green is<>shown to be committed to silicon use. Choice B is incorrect because in this context the phrase “betting on” is gurative and<>implies believing in something, not actually being involved with games of chance.

The creatures are strongly attracted to those colors, Dabiri says. The researchers shone the blue laser into<>             the tank and moved it slowly up and down to control the crustaceans’ vertical movements. The tank’s solid walls could strongly affect the<>               ow patterns generated by the shrimp as they swam, so the researchers kept the shrimp away from the edges of the tank by shining the<>          5  green laser beam directly down into the center. To help visualize the swirls and eddies generated by the shrimp, the researchers added<>             copious amounts of silver-coated microspheres to the water and illuminated them with a red laser, a color that doesn’t seem to affect the<>             shrimps’ behavior.<>                  The team’s high-speed videos of the teeming, laser-lit migrations captured images of swirls much larger than the creatures<>             themselves, which resulted from the interactions of smaller ows created by individuals. The larger the swirls, the more effective the<>         10  mixing might be, Dabiri says. “So even for slow migrations, there could be strong effects,” he notes.<>                  Previous studies suggest that light-harvesting phytoplankton, the base of the ocean’s food chain, collect about 60 terawatt-hours of<>             solar energy, Dabiri says. Even if marine organisms that consume phytoplankton convert only 1% of that power into mixing the oceans,<>             that’s collectively comparable to the mixing power of winds and tides, Dabiri and Wilhelmus report.<>                  “This is a really innovative experimental setup that provides a nice illustration of ow velocities,” says Christian Noss, a uid<>         15  dynamicist at the University of Koblenz-Landau.

You pass through long stretches of country<>             without counting anything. When you do see houses, they’re clustered into towns, and may have spacious yards with tire swings. As you<>             approach a city ( nally!), rows of houses appear at regular intervals instead of clumping. And in the heart of the city they shrink into little<>             apartments that go by too fast for you to count. European rabbits, it turns out, build their homes in a similar way—and since these animals<>          5  are disappearing in the countryside, understanding their urban planning strategy matters to humans trying to conserve them.<>                 Hunting, habitat loss, and disease have driven down populations of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in the countrysides of<>             western Europe. Yet rabbit populations in some German cities are, well, hopping. Madlen Ziege, a graduate student at the University of<>             Frankfurt, and her coauthors wanted to know how rabbits are taking advantage of urban areas. They chose the city of Frankfurt, where<>             European rabbits have lived alongside humans since at least 1930.<>         10      The researchers scoured nine city parks in Frankfurt for rabbit burrows, along with four more suburban parks and three nearby rural<>             sites. In all, they found 191 burrows. Then they rated each site for its “urbanity,” a measure that included three variables: How many people<>             live within half a kilometer of the burrow site? How many pedestrians, bikers, or dogs pass by at dawn and dusk, when rabbits are most<>             active? And how much of the ground is covered by something arti cial, such as pavement or playground turf?<>                 Like census-takers, albeit with a serious language barrier, the researchers tried to count how many rabbits lived in each burrow. For a<>         15  few dozen burrows, they did this by tagging along with a regular hunting group that ushed the rabbits from their holes with trained<>             ferrets. At other sites, the researchers staked out burrows at dawn and dusk and tallied how many rabbits came and went. They also<>             counted burrow entrances to estimate how big each home was.<>                 As “urbanity” increased—as sites became less rural and more city-like—rabbit burrows became more common. Urban burrows were<>             smaller and simpler, like studio apartments compared to country estates. And while rural burrows were spread out and clumped, like the<>         20  rural houses on our imaginary road trip, urban burrows were spaced out more evenly.<>                 Ziege writes that the results could easily have been the opposite. Since cities cover up more ground with pavement and buildings,<>             breaking potential habitat into fragments, city rabbits might end up clustered into big burrows like they do in the countryside. Instead,<>             they’re spread out into small homes.<>                 One reason might be heat. Big groups of rabbits keep their burrows toastier in the winter—but cities are a little warmer to begin with, so<>         25  living with a lot of warm bodies might not be as important. In the countryside, large burrows with many entrances and escape routes also<>             help protect rabbits from predators. But in the city, there are fewer predators.<>                 Finally, rabbits tend to live in large groups when their resources are limited. In German cities, they may be spreading out because<>             there’s no shortage of food or burrowing space. Country life may mean hunger and hunting ferrets, but for urban rabbits, life is (so far)<>             good.<>             Figure 1<>             Figure 2<><>|        Figures adapted from M.

            Questions 21-31 are based on the following passage and supplementary material.<>            This passage is adapted from Marlene Zuk, Paleofantasy: What Evolution Really Tells Us about Sex, Diet, and How We Live.<>            ©2013 by Marlene Zuk.<>       Line      A female guppy can be sexually mature at two months of age and have her rst babies just a month later. This unstinting rate of<>             reproduction makes guppies ideally suited for studying the rate of evolution, and David Reznick, a biologist at UC Riverside, has been<>             doing exactly that for the last few decades.<>                 People usually think of guppies as colorful aquarium sh, but they also have a life in the real world, inhabiting streams and rivers in<>          5  tropical places like Trinidad, where Reznick has done his eldwork. Guppies can experience different kinds of conditions depending on<>             the luck of the draw. A lucky guppy is born above a waterfall or a set of rapids, which keep out the predatory sh called pike cichlids<>             found in calmer downstream waters. As you might expect, the guppy mortality rate—that is, the proportion of individuals that die—is<>             much higher in the sites with the rapacious cichlids than in those without them.<>                 Reznick has shown that if you bring the sh into the lab and let them breed there, the guppies from the sites with many predators<>         10  become sexually mature when they are younger and smaller than do the guppies from the predator-free sites. In addition, the litters of<>             baby guppies produced by mothers from the high-risk streams are larger, but each individual baby is smaller than those produced by their<>             counterparts. The disparity makes sense because if you are at risk of being eaten, being able to have babies sooner, and spreading your<>             energy reserves over a lot of them, makes it more likely that you will manage to pass on some of your genes before you meet your fate.<>             Reznick and other scientists also demonstrated that these traits are controlled by the guppies’ genes, not by the environment in which<>         15  they grow up.<>                 How quickly, though, could these differences in how the two kinds of guppies lived their lives have evolved? Because there are<>             numerous tributaries of the streams in Trinidad, with guppies living in some but not all of them, Reznick realized that he could, as he put<>             it in a 2008 paper, “treat streams like giant test tubes by introducing guppies or predators” to places they had not originally occurred, and<>             then watch as natural selection acted on the guppies. This kind of real-world manipulation of nature is called “experimental evolution,”<>         20  and it is growing increasingly popular among scientists working with organisms that reproduce quickly enough for humans to be able to<>             see the outcome within our lifetimes.<>                 Along with his students and colleagues, Reznick removed groups of guppies from their predator-ridden lives below the waterfall and<>             released them into previously guppy-free streams above the falls. Although small predatory killi sh occurred in these new sites, these<>               sh do not pose anything close to the danger of the cichlids. Then the scientists waited for nature to do its work, and they brought the<>         25  descendants of the transplanted sh back to the lab to examine their reproduction. After just eleven years, the guppies released in the<>             new streams had evolved to mature later, and have fewer, bigger offspring in each litter, just like the guppies that naturally occurred in the<>             cichlid-free streams. Other studies of guppies in Trinidad have shown evolutionary change in as few as two and a half years, or a little<>             over four generations, with more time required for genetic shifts in traits such as the ability to form schools and less time for changes in<>             the colorful spots and stripes on a male’s body.<>             Figure 1<>             Figure 2<><>|                                            Figures adapted from David N.

            Questions 11-21 are based on the following passage and supplementary material.<>            This passage is adapted from Elizabeth Svoboda, What Makes a Hero?

This<>              connection appears to hold true regardless of culture: In a 2012 study of older Maori and non-Maori in New Zealand, those who volunteered<>              more often scored higher on happiness measures.<>          5      In best-case scenarios, regular helping may even help stave off an early death. Analyzing data from more than seven thousand<>              respondents collected for the government’s Longitudinal Study of Aging, the researchers Alex Harris and Carl Thoresen found that<>              frequent volunteers had a 19 percent lower mortality risk than people who never volunteered when the subjects’ level of social support<>              was taken into account.

Even more dramatically, when University of Michigan researchers studied 423 older couples who were followed for ve years,<>         10   those who helped others were nearly 60 percent less likely to die during the study period than those who never helped.<>                 While many survey studies have found more or less strong associations between helping and happiness, the University of California,<>              Riverside, psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky wanted to test the connection in a real-world setting. She asked students to carry out ve<>              “random acts of kindness” of their choice every week for six weeks—they could choose anything that bene ted others, from making a<>              homeless person a meal to helping a kid with a school assignment. The subjects experienced higher levels of happiness than controls<>         15   when they performed all ve kind acts in one day, suggesting that the well-being boost is pronounced when people help often.<>                 Interestingly, though, students who spaced the kind acts out, performing them on different days, didn’t experience the same happiness<>              boost. Lyubomirsky’s work suggests altruistic acts may need to be frequent in order to confer a lasting change in well-being. With isolated<>              acts of helping, says the London School of Economics social scientist Francesca Borgonovi, “it could be that there’s a very short—narrowly<>              de ned in time and space—bump in happiness that doesn’t shift your [overall] happiness in any meaningful way.”<>         20      On balance, though, being generous boosts your mood and health because it strengthens your sense that you’re really doing something<>              signi cant.

                                           Evidence<>            Questions 43-52 are based on the following passage and supplementary material.<>            This passage is adapted from Kevin Bullis, “What Tech Is Next for the Solar Industry?” ©2013 by MIT Technology Review.<>       Line     The technology that’s surprised almost everyone is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago, silicon solar panels cost $4 per<>             watt, and Martin Green, professor at the University of New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar panel researchers, declared<>             that they’d never go below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per watt,” he says.<>                The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar panels, but for complete, installed<>          5  systems—by 2020. Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the direct cost of solar<>             power to six cents per kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost expected for power from new natural gas power plants.<>                All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the power output of solar panels, and<>             that’s led to steady cost reductions. Green points to something as mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of the features on<>             solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar cell in the 1990s that set a record ef ciency for silicon solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To<>         10  achieve that record, he had to use expensive lithography techniques to make ne wires for collecting current from the solar cell. But<>             gradual improvements have made it possible to use screen printing to produce ever- ner lines. Recent research suggests that screen-<>             printing techniques can produce lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at<>             costs far lower than his lithography techniques.<>                Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have made exible solar cells on a new type of glass from<>         15  Corning called Willow Glass, which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar cell they made is the only current challenger to silicon in<>             terms of large-scale production—thin- lm cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower the cost of installing solar cells, making<>             solar power cheaper.<>                One of Green’s former students and colleagues, Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer China Sunergy, announced this<>             week that he is building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided solar cell that can absorb light from both the front and back. The basic<>         20  idea, which isn’t new, is that during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the land between rows of solar panels in a solar power<>             plant. That light re ects onto the back of the panels and could be harvested to increase the power output. This works particularly well<>             when the solar panels are built on sand, which is highly re ective. Where a one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a two-sided<>             one might generate up to 400 watts. He expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more electricity over the course of a year.<>                Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon, aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in cost already seen with the<>         25  technology. He hopes to greatly increase the ef ciency of silicon solar panels by combining silicon with one or two other semiconductors,<>             each selected to ef ciently convert a part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert ef ciently. Adding one semiconductor could<>             boost ef ciencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to around 40 percent. Adding another could make ef ciencies as high as 50 percent<>             feasible, which would cut in half the number of solar panels needed for a given installation. The challenge is to produce good connections<>             between these semiconductors, something made challenging by the arrangement of silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.<>             Figure 1<>             Adapted from Peter Schwartz, “Abundant Natural Gas and Oil Are Putting the Kibosh on Clean Energy.” ©2012 by Condé Nast.<>             Figure 2<><>|    Adapted from Ramez Naam, “Smaller, Cheaper, Faster: Does Moore’s Law Apply to Solar Cells?” ©2011 by Scienti c American.|      According to ﬁgure 2, in what year is the average cost of solar photovoltaic power projected to be equal to the 2009 US<>      average electricity cost?<>    A. 2018<>    B. 2020<>|    D. 2027<>Rationale<>Choice B is the best answer.

So he brought in some hay bales for the<>                Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.<>                    Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. “I asked him how it went,” Ken recalled,<>         10     “and he said, ‘Terrible!

Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was<>                the “aha” moment. “The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively,” he told me, and that single observation opened up a world<>                of possibilities.<>                    Working together with Terry (who has since gone on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious<>         15     experiments, lming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges<>                began to ap, but they angled their wings differently from birds in ight. They aimed their apping down and backward, using the<>                force not for lift but to keep their feet rmly pressed against the ramp. “It’s like the spoiler on the back of a race car,” he explained,<>                which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, spoilers are the big aerodynamic ns that push the cars downward as they speed<>                along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up<>         20     otherwise impossible slopes.<>                    Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species.

You pass through long stretches of country<>             without counting anything. When you do see houses, they’re clustered into towns, and may have spacious yards with tire swings. As you<>             approach a city ( nally!), rows of houses appear at regular intervals instead of clumping. And in the heart of the city they shrink into little<>             apartments that go by too fast for you to count. European rabbits, it turns out, build their homes in a similar way—and since these animals<>          5  are disappearing in the countryside, understanding their urban planning strategy matters to humans trying to conserve them.<>                 Hunting, habitat loss, and disease have driven down populations of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in the countrysides of<>             western Europe. Yet rabbit populations in some German cities are, well, hopping. Madlen Ziege, a graduate student at the University of<>             Frankfurt, and her coauthors wanted to know how rabbits are taking advantage of urban areas. They chose the city of Frankfurt, where<>             European rabbits have lived alongside humans since at least 1930.<>         10      The researchers scoured nine city parks in Frankfurt for rabbit burrows, along with four more suburban parks and three nearby rural<>             sites. In all, they found 191 burrows. Then they rated each site for its “urbanity,” a measure that included three variables: How many people<>             live within half a kilometer of the burrow site? How many pedestrians, bikers, or dogs pass by at dawn and dusk, when rabbits are most<>             active? And how much of the ground is covered by something arti cial, such as pavement or playground turf?<>                 Like census-takers, albeit with a serious language barrier, the researchers tried to count how many rabbits lived in each burrow. For a<>         15  few dozen burrows, they did this by tagging along with a regular hunting group that ushed the rabbits from their holes with trained<>             ferrets. At other sites, the researchers staked out burrows at dawn and dusk and tallied how many rabbits came and went. They also<>             counted burrow entrances to estimate how big each home was.<>                 As “urbanity” increased—as sites became less rural and more city-like—rabbit burrows became more common. Urban burrows were<>             smaller and simpler, like studio apartments compared to country estates. And while rural burrows were spread out and clumped, like the<>         20  rural houses on our imaginary road trip, urban burrows were spaced out more evenly.<>                 Ziege writes that the results could easily have been the opposite. Since cities cover up more ground with pavement and buildings,<>             breaking potential habitat into fragments, city rabbits might end up clustered into big burrows like they do in the countryside. Instead,<>             they’re spread out into small homes.<>                 One reason might be heat. Big groups of rabbits keep their burrows toastier in the winter—but cities are a little warmer to begin with, so<>         25  living with a lot of warm bodies might not be as important. In the countryside, large burrows with many entrances and escape routes also<>             help protect rabbits from predators. But in the city, there are fewer predators.<>                 Finally, rabbits tend to live in large groups when their resources are limited. In German cities, they may be spreading out because<>             there’s no shortage of food or burrowing space. Country life may mean hunger and hunting ferrets, but for urban rabbits, life is (so far)<>             good.<>             Figure 1<>             Figure 2<><>|        Figures adapted from M.

The creatures are strongly attracted to those colors, Dabiri says. The researchers shone the blue laser into<>             the tank and moved it slowly up and down to control the crustaceans’ vertical movements. The tank’s solid walls could strongly affect the<>               ow patterns generated by the shrimp as they swam, so the researchers kept the shrimp away from the edges of the tank by shining the<>          5  green laser beam directly down into the center. To help visualize the swirls and eddies generated by the shrimp, the researchers added<>             copious amounts of silver-coated microspheres to the water and illuminated them with a red laser, a color that doesn’t seem to affect the<>             shrimps’ behavior.<>                  The team’s high-speed videos of the teeming, laser-lit migrations captured images of swirls much larger than the creatures<>             themselves, which resulted from the interactions of smaller ows created by individuals. The larger the swirls, the more effective the<>         10  mixing might be, Dabiri says. “So even for slow migrations, there could be strong effects,” he notes.<>                  Previous studies suggest that light-harvesting phytoplankton, the base of the ocean’s food chain, collect about 60 terawatt-hours of<>             solar energy, Dabiri says. Even if marine organisms that consume phytoplankton convert only 1% of that power into mixing the oceans,<>             that’s collectively comparable to the mixing power of winds and tides, Dabiri and Wilhelmus report.<>                  “This is a really innovative experimental setup that provides a nice illustration of ow velocities,” says Christian Noss, a uid<>         15  dynamicist at the University of Koblenz-Landau.

André Visser, a physical oceanographer at the Technical University of Denmark,<>         20  agrees. “Most of the energy [from the shrimp] probably goes into heating the water” rather than mixing it, he says.<>                  In fact, the upper and lower layers of the seas have measurable differences in density, a strati cation that, according to theory, would<>             reduce the ef ciency of any biomixing. And subsequently, experiments similar to Dabiri’s suggested that strati cation sti es mixing. In<>             that research, Noss and colleague Andreas Lorke, also of Koblenz-Landau, studied the effects of large crowds of aquatic creatures called<>             Daphnia (commonly known as water eas) as they migrated up and down in a tank of mildly strati ed water. As expected, the<>         25  strati cation squelched the biomixing generated by the swimming Daphnia, Noss says. Those results aren’t surprising, Visser says. “It’s<>             dif cult to lift heavy water up and to push light water down.”<>                  Dabiri and his colleagues’ next set of lab experiments will look at the effects of sea monkey migrations in strati ed waters, he says.<>             Those experiments should reveal whether sea monkeys are better mixers than water eas.<><>|      According to the passage, Monismith is not convinced that Dabiri and Wilhelmus’s results can be|     A. generalized to the natural environment.<>     B. replicated under the same conditions.<>     C. veri ed by other researchers.<>     D. reconciled with earlier ndings.<>|Choice A is the best answer.

            Questions 22-31 are based on the following passage.<>            This passage is adapted from Patricia Waldron, “Why Birds Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for the<>            Advancement of Science.<>       Line        Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds y in a V formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new<>                study of ibises nds that these big-winged birds carefully position their wingtips and sync their apping, presumably to catch the<>                preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy during ight.<>                   There are two reasons birds might y in a V formation: It may make ight easier, or they’re simply following the leader. Squadrons of<>          5     planes can save fuel by ying in a V formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated<>                  apping birds like xed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting off each other, but currents created by airplanes are<>                far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a apping wing,” says James<>                Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the University of London in Hat eld, where the research took<>                place.<>         10        The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus<>                eremita) to Europe. Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A<>                  ock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device’s GPS determined each bird’s ight<>                position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing aps.<>                   Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to y just behind and to the side of the bird in front,<>         15     timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird ew directly behind another, the timing of the apping reversed so<>                that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body. “We didn’t think this was possible,”<>                Usherwood says, considering that the feat requires careful ight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors. “Perhaps these big V<>                formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down.”<>                   The ndings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more<>         20     complex wakes that would make drafting too dif cult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings because<>                the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can<>                use 20 percent to 30 percent less energy while ying in a V.<>                   “From a behavioral perspective it’s really a breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo<>                Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. “Showing that birds care about syncing their wing beats is de nitely an important<>         25     insight that we didn’t have before.”<>                   Scientists do not know how the birds nd that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either<>                by sight or by sensing air currents through their feathers. Alternatively, they may move around until they nd the location with the<>                least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to<>                investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through<>         30     the rest of the ock to cause traf c jams.<>                   “It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,” says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the<>                University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies ight aerodynamics in birds and insects.

            Questions 11-21 are based on the following passage and supplementary material.<>            This passage is adapted from Elizabeth Svoboda, What Makes a Hero? The Surprising Science of Sel essness. ©2013 by<>            Elizabeth Svoboda.<>       Line      In a 2010 survey of more than 4,500 American volunteers, 89 percent—nearly 9 in 10—stated that volunteering improved their sense of<>              well-being, while a sizable majority reported that it lowered their stress levels and enhanced their sense of purpose in life. This<>              connection appears to hold true regardless of culture: In a 2012 study of older Maori and non-Maori in New Zealand, those who volunteered<>              more often scored higher on happiness measures.<>          5      In best-case scenarios, regular helping may even help stave off an early death. Analyzing data from more than seven thousand<>              respondents collected for the government’s Longitudinal Study of Aging, the researchers Alex Harris and Carl Thoresen found that<>              frequent volunteers had a 19 percent lower mortality risk than people who never volunteered when the subjects’ level of social support<>              was taken into account. That means volunteering is associated with longer survival independent of the advantages social ties<>              provide. Even more dramatically, when University of Michigan researchers studied 423 older couples who were followed for ve years,<>         10   those who helped others were nearly 60 percent less likely to die during the study period than those who never helped.<>                 While many survey studies have found more or less strong associations between helping and happiness, the University of California,<>              Riverside, psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky wanted to test the connection in a real-world setting. She asked students to carry out ve<>              “random acts of kindness” of their choice every week for six weeks—they could choose anything that bene ted others, from making a<>              homeless person a meal to helping a kid with a school assignment. The subjects experienced higher levels of happiness than controls<>         15   when they performed all ve kind acts in one day, suggesting that the well-being boost is pronounced when people help often.<>                 Interestingly, though, students who spaced the kind acts out, performing them on different days, didn’t experience the same happiness<>              boost. Lyubomirsky’s work suggests altruistic acts may need to be frequent in order to confer a lasting change in well-being. With isolated<>              acts of helping, says the London School of Economics social scientist Francesca Borgonovi, “it could be that there’s a very short—narrowly<>              de ned in time and space—bump in happiness that doesn’t shift your [overall] happiness in any meaningful way.”<>         20      On balance, though, being generous boosts your mood and health because it strengthens your sense that you’re really doing something<>              signi cant. The social psychologist Sara Konrath of the University of Michigan notes that helping others may signal our bodies to release<>              pleasurable chemicals such as oxytocin. The boost we get from helping may also mute our stress response, causing us to release fewer<>              jarring stress hormones such as cortisol and norepinephrine.<>              Adapted from “Volunteering and Your Health: How Giving Back Benefits Everyone.” ©2010 by UnitedHealth Group.<>              Adapted from Sonja Lyubomirsky, Kennon M.

One nding of Lyubomirsky’s study was that people who performed acts of kindness less frequently<>reported a lower boost in overall happiness.

Thus, the author<>most likely includes the quotation from Borgonovi to provide a possible explanation for a result of Lyubomirsky’s study.<>Choice A is incorrect because the hypothesis the study was intended to test is made clear in the study description in the fourth<>paragraph, and Borgonovi’s quote doesn’t mention the hypothesis at all.

            Questions 22-31 are based on the following passage.<>            This passage is adapted from Patricia Waldron, “Why Birds Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for the<>            Advancement of Science.<>       Line        Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds y in a V formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new<>                study of ibises nds that these big-winged birds carefully position their wingtips and sync their apping, presumably to catch the<>                preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy during ight.<>                   There are two reasons birds might y in a V formation: It may make ight easier, or they’re simply following the leader. Squadrons of<>          5     planes can save fuel by ying in a V formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated<>                  apping birds like xed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting off each other, but currents created by airplanes are<>                far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a apping wing,” says James<>                Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the University of London in Hat eld, where the research took<>                place.<>         10        The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus<>                eremita) to Europe. Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A<>                  ock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device’s GPS determined each bird’s ight<>                position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing aps.<>                   Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to y just behind and to the side of the bird in front,<>         15     timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird ew directly behind another, the timing of the apping reversed so<>                that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body. “We didn’t think this was possible,”<>                Usherwood says, considering that the feat requires careful ight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors. “Perhaps these big V<>                formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down.”<>                   The ndings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more<>         20     complex wakes that would make drafting too dif cult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings because<>                the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can<>                use 20 percent to 30 percent less energy while ying in a V.<>                   “From a behavioral perspective it’s really a breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo<>                Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. “Showing that birds care about syncing their wing beats is de nitely an important<>         25     insight that we didn’t have before.”<>                   Scientists do not know how the birds nd that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either<>                by sight or by sensing air currents through their feathers. Alternatively, they may move around until they nd the location with the<>                least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to<>                investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through<>         30     the rest of the ock to cause traf c jams.<>                   “It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,” says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the<>                University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies ight aerodynamics in birds and insects.

A few years ago, silicon solar panels cost $4 per<>             watt, and Martin Green, professor at the University of New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar panel researchers, declared<>             that they’d never go below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per watt,” he says.<>                The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar panels, but for complete, installed<>          5  systems—by 2020. Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the direct cost of solar<>             power to six cents per kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost expected for power from new natural gas power plants.<>                All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the power output of solar panels, and<>             that’s led to steady cost reductions. Green points to something as mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of the features on<>             solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar cell in the 1990s that set a record ef ciency for silicon solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To<>         10  achieve that record, he had to use expensive lithography techniques to make ne wires for collecting current from the solar cell. But<>             gradual improvements have made it possible to use screen printing to produce ever- ner lines. Recent research suggests that screen-<>             printing techniques can produce lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at<>             costs far lower than his lithography techniques.<>                Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have made exible solar cells on a new type of glass from<>         15  Corning called Willow Glass, which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar cell they made is the only current challenger to silicon in<>             terms of large-scale production—thin- lm cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower the cost of installing solar cells, making<>             solar power cheaper.<>                One of Green’s former students and colleagues, Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer China Sunergy, announced this<>             week that he is building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided solar cell that can absorb light from both the front and back. The basic<>         20  idea, which isn’t new, is that during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the land between rows of solar panels in a solar power<>             plant. That light re ects onto the back of the panels and could be harvested to increase the power output. This works particularly well<>             when the solar panels are built on sand, which is highly re ective. Where a one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a two-sided<>             one might generate up to 400 watts. He expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more electricity over the course of a year.<>                Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon, aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in cost already seen with the<>         25  technology. He hopes to greatly increase the ef ciency of silicon solar panels by combining silicon with one or two other semiconductors,<>             each selected to ef ciently convert a part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert ef ciently. Adding one semiconductor could<>             boost ef ciencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to around 40 percent. Adding another could make ef ciencies as high as 50 percent<>             feasible, which would cut in half the number of solar panels needed for a given installation. The challenge is to produce good connections<>             between these semiconductors, something made challenging by the arrangement of silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.<>             Figure 1<>             Adapted from Peter Schwartz, “Abundant Natural Gas and Oil Are Putting the Kibosh on Clean Energy.” ©2012 by Condé Nast.<>             Figure 2<><>|   Adapted from Ramez Naam, “Smaller, Cheaper, Faster: Does Moore’s Law Apply to Solar Cells?” ©2011 by Scienti c American.|     As used in line 24, “betting on” most nearly means<>    A. dabbling in.<>    B. gambling with.<>    C. switching from.<>|Rationale<>Choice D is the best answer.

You pass through long stretches of country<>             without counting anything. When you do see houses, they’re clustered into towns, and may have spacious yards with tire swings. As you<>             approach a city ( nally!), rows of houses appear at regular intervals instead of clumping. And in the heart of the city they shrink into little<>             apartments that go by too fast for you to count. European rabbits, it turns out, build their homes in a similar way—and since these animals<>          5  are disappearing in the countryside, understanding their urban planning strategy matters to humans trying to conserve them.<>                 Hunting, habitat loss, and disease have driven down populations of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in the countrysides of<>             western Europe. Yet rabbit populations in some German cities are, well, hopping. Madlen Ziege, a graduate student at the University of<>             Frankfurt, and her coauthors wanted to know how rabbits are taking advantage of urban areas. They chose the city of Frankfurt, where<>             European rabbits have lived alongside humans since at least 1930.<>         10      The researchers scoured nine city parks in Frankfurt for rabbit burrows, along with four more suburban parks and three nearby rural<>             sites. In all, they found 191 burrows. Then they rated each site for its “urbanity,” a measure that included three variables: How many people<>             live within half a kilometer of the burrow site? How many pedestrians, bikers, or dogs pass by at dawn and dusk, when rabbits are most<>             active? And how much of the ground is covered by something arti cial, such as pavement or playground turf?<>                 Like census-takers, albeit with a serious language barrier, the researchers tried to count how many rabbits lived in each burrow. For a<>         15  few dozen burrows, they did this by tagging along with a regular hunting group that ushed the rabbits from their holes with trained<>             ferrets. At other sites, the researchers staked out burrows at dawn and dusk and tallied how many rabbits came and went. They also<>             counted burrow entrances to estimate how big each home was.<>                 As “urbanity” increased—as sites became less rural and more city-like—rabbit burrows became more common. Urban burrows were<>             smaller and simpler, like studio apartments compared to country estates. And while rural burrows were spread out and clumped, like the<>         20  rural houses on our imaginary road trip, urban burrows were spaced out more evenly.<>                 Ziege writes that the results could easily have been the opposite. Since cities cover up more ground with pavement and buildings,<>             breaking potential habitat into fragments, city rabbits might end up clustered into big burrows like they do in the countryside. Instead,<>             they’re spread out into small homes.<>                 One reason might be heat. Big groups of rabbits keep their burrows toastier in the winter—but cities are a little warmer to begin with, so<>         25  living with a lot of warm bodies might not be as important. In the countryside, large burrows with many entrances and escape routes also<>             help protect rabbits from predators. But in the city, there are fewer predators.<>                 Finally, rabbits tend to live in large groups when their resources are limited. In German cities, they may be spreading out because<>             there’s no shortage of food or burrowing space. Country life may mean hunger and hunting ferrets, but for urban rabbits, life is (so far)<>             good.<>             Figure 1<>             Figure 2<><>|        Figures adapted from M.

This unstinting rate of<>             reproduction makes guppies ideally suited for studying the rate of evolution, and David Reznick, a biologist at UC Riverside, has been<>             doing exactly that for the last few decades.<>                 People usually think of guppies as colorful aquarium sh, but they also have a life in the real world, inhabiting streams and rivers in<>          5  tropical places like Trinidad, where Reznick has done his eldwork. Guppies can experience different kinds of conditions depending on<>             the luck of the draw. A lucky guppy is born above a waterfall or a set of rapids, which keep out the predatory sh called pike cichlids<>             found in calmer downstream waters. As you might expect, the guppy mortality rate—that is, the proportion of individuals that die—is<>             much higher in the sites with the rapacious cichlids than in those without them.<>                 Reznick has shown that if you bring the sh into the lab and let them breed there, the guppies from the sites with many predators<>         10  become sexually mature when they are younger and smaller than do the guppies from the predator-free sites. In addition, the litters of<>             baby guppies produced by mothers from the high-risk streams are larger, but each individual baby is smaller than those produced by their<>             counterparts. The disparity makes sense because if you are at risk of being eaten, being able to have babies sooner, and spreading your<>             energy reserves over a lot of them, makes it more likely that you will manage to pass on some of your genes before you meet your fate.<>             Reznick and other scientists also demonstrated that these traits are controlled by the guppies’ genes, not by the environment in which<>         15  they grow up.<>                 How quickly, though, could these differences in how the two kinds of guppies lived their lives have evolved? Because there are<>             numerous tributaries of the streams in Trinidad, with guppies living in some but not all of them, Reznick realized that he could, as he put<>             it in a 2008 paper, “treat streams like giant test tubes by introducing guppies or predators” to places they had not originally occurred, and<>             then watch as natural selection acted on the guppies. This kind of real-world manipulation of nature is called “experimental evolution,”<>         20  and it is growing increasingly popular among scientists working with organisms that reproduce quickly enough for humans to be able to<>             see the outcome within our lifetimes.<>                 Along with his students and colleagues, Reznick removed groups of guppies from their predator-ridden lives below the waterfall and<>             released them into previously guppy-free streams above the falls. Although small predatory killi sh occurred in these new sites, these<>               sh do not pose anything close to the danger of the cichlids. Then the scientists waited for nature to do its work, and they brought the<>         25  descendants of the transplanted sh back to the lab to examine their reproduction. After just eleven years, the guppies released in the<>             new streams had evolved to mature later, and have fewer, bigger offspring in each litter, just like the guppies that naturally occurred in the<>             cichlid-free streams. Other studies of guppies in Trinidad have shown evolutionary change in as few as two and a half years, or a little<>             over four generations, with more time required for genetic shifts in traits such as the ability to form schools and less time for changes in<>             the colorful spots and stripes on a male’s body.<>             Figure 1<>             Figure 2<><>|                                       Figures adapted from David N.

If it were<>discovered that the new site into which Reznick released the guppies were inhabited by sh found to be as predatory as the<>cichlids in the original sites, this discovery would undermine Reznick’s ndings.

                                           Evidence<>            Questions 43-52 are based on the following passage and supplementary material.<>            This passage is adapted from Kevin Bullis, “What Tech Is Next for the Solar Industry?” ©2013 by MIT Technology Review.<>       Line     The technology that’s surprised almost everyone is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago, silicon solar panels cost $4 per<>             watt, and Martin Green, professor at the University of New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar panel researchers, declared<>             that they’d never go below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per watt,” he says.<>                The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar panels, but for complete, installed<>          5  systems—by 2020. Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the direct cost of solar<>             power to six cents per kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost expected for power from new natural gas power plants.<>                All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the power output of solar panels, and<>             that’s led to steady cost reductions. Green points to something as mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of the features on<>             solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar cell in the 1990s that set a record ef ciency for silicon solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To<>         10  achieve that record, he had to use expensive lithography techniques to make ne wires for collecting current from the solar cell. But<>             gradual improvements have made it possible to use screen printing to produce ever- ner lines. Recent research suggests that screen-<>             printing techniques can produce lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at<>             costs far lower than his lithography techniques.<>                Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have made exible solar cells on a new type of glass from<>         15  Corning called Willow Glass, which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar cell they made is the only current challenger to silicon in<>             terms of large-scale production—thin- lm cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower the cost of installing solar cells, making<>             solar power cheaper.<>                One of Green’s former students and colleagues, Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer China Sunergy, announced this<>             week that he is building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided solar cell that can absorb light from both the front and back. The basic<>         20  idea, which isn’t new, is that during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the land between rows of solar panels in a solar power<>             plant. That light re ects onto the back of the panels and could be harvested to increase the power output. This works particularly well<>             when the solar panels are built on sand, which is highly re ective. Where a one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a two-sided<>             one might generate up to 400 watts. He expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more electricity over the course of a year.<>                Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon, aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in cost already seen with the<>         25  technology. He hopes to greatly increase the ef ciency of silicon solar panels by combining silicon with one or two other semiconductors,<>             each selected to ef ciently convert a part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert ef ciently. Adding one semiconductor could<>             boost ef ciencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to around 40 percent. Adding another could make ef ciencies as high as 50 percent<>             feasible, which would cut in half the number of solar panels needed for a given installation. The challenge is to produce good connections<>             between these semiconductors, something made challenging by the arrangement of silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.<>             Figure 1<>             Adapted from Peter Schwartz, “Abundant Natural Gas and Oil Are Putting the Kibosh on Clean Energy.” ©2012 by Condé Nast.<>             Figure 2<><>|    Adapted from Ramez Naam, “Smaller, Cheaper, Faster: Does Moore’s Law Apply to Solar Cells?” ©2011 by Scienti c American.|      According to ﬁgure 2, in what year is the average cost of solar photovoltaic power projected to be equal to the 2009 US<>      average electricity cost?<>    A. 2018<>    B. 2020<>|    D. 2027<>Rationale<>Choice B is the best answer.

But as he thought about it<>                Ken realized that all the species he’d watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where<>                they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought in some hay bales for the<>                Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.<>                    Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. “I asked him how it went,” Ken recalled,<>         10     “and he said, ‘Terrible! The birds are cheating!’ ” Instead of ying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and<>                again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, apping all the while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was<>                the “aha” moment. “The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively,” he told me, and that single observation opened up a world<>                of possibilities.<>                    Working together with Terry (who has since gone on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious<>         15     experiments, lming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges<>                began to ap, but they angled their wings differently from birds in ight. They aimed their apping down and backward, using the<>                force not for lift but to keep their feet rmly pressed against the ramp. “It’s like the spoiler on the back of a race car,” he explained,<>                which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, spoilers are the big aerodynamic ns that push the cars downward as they speed<>                along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up<>         20     otherwise impossible slopes.<>                    Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only<>                allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the rst few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-ef cient alternative to<>                  ying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the<>                wall and onto the ceiling.<>         25         In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable<>                origin for the apping ight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don’t do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and<>                an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis).<><>|     The passage identiﬁes which of the following as a factor that facilitated the baby Chukars’ traction on steep ramps?|    A.

You pass through long stretches of country<>             without counting anything. When you do see houses, they’re clustered into towns, and may have spacious yards with tire swings. As you<>             approach a city ( nally!), rows of houses appear at regular intervals instead of clumping. And in the heart of the city they shrink into little<>             apartments that go by too fast for you to count. European rabbits, it turns out, build their homes in a similar way—and since these animals<>          5  are disappearing in the countryside, understanding their urban planning strategy matters to humans trying to conserve them.<>                 Hunting, habitat loss, and disease have driven down populations of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in the countrysides of<>             western Europe. Yet rabbit populations in some German cities are, well, hopping. Madlen Ziege, a graduate student at the University of<>             Frankfurt, and her coauthors wanted to know how rabbits are taking advantage of urban areas. They chose the city of Frankfurt, where<>             European rabbits have lived alongside humans since at least 1930.<>         10      The researchers scoured nine city parks in Frankfurt for rabbit burrows, along with four more suburban parks and three nearby rural<>             sites. In all, they found 191 burrows. Then they rated each site for its “urbanity,” a measure that included three variables: How many people<>             live within half a kilometer of the burrow site? How many pedestrians, bikers, or dogs pass by at dawn and dusk, when rabbits are most<>             active? And how much of the ground is covered by something arti cial, such as pavement or playground turf?<>                 Like census-takers, albeit with a serious language barrier, the researchers tried to count how many rabbits lived in each burrow. For a<>         15  few dozen burrows, they did this by tagging along with a regular hunting group that ushed the rabbits from their holes with trained<>             ferrets. At other sites, the researchers staked out burrows at dawn and dusk and tallied how many rabbits came and went. They also<>             counted burrow entrances to estimate how big each home was.<>                 As “urbanity” increased—as sites became less rural and more city-like—rabbit burrows became more common. Urban burrows were<>             smaller and simpler, like studio apartments compared to country estates. And while rural burrows were spread out and clumped, like the<>         20  rural houses on our imaginary road trip, urban burrows were spaced out more evenly.<>                 Ziege writes that the results could easily have been the opposite. Since cities cover up more ground with pavement and buildings,<>             breaking potential habitat into fragments, city rabbits might end up clustered into big burrows like they do in the countryside. Instead,<>             they’re spread out into small homes.<>                 One reason might be heat. Big groups of rabbits keep their burrows toastier in the winter—but cities are a little warmer to begin with, so<>         25  living with a lot of warm bodies might not be as important. In the countryside, large burrows with many entrances and escape routes also<>             help protect rabbits from predators. But in the city, there are fewer predators.<>                 Finally, rabbits tend to live in large groups when their resources are limited. In German cities, they may be spreading out because<>             there’s no shortage of food or burrowing space. Country life may mean hunger and hunting ferrets, but for urban rabbits, life is (so far)<>             good.<>             Figure 1<>             Figure 2<><>|        Figures adapted from M.

The creatures are strongly attracted to those colors, Dabiri says. The researchers shone the blue laser into<>             the tank and moved it slowly up and down to control the crustaceans’ vertical movements. The tank’s solid walls could strongly affect the<>               ow patterns generated by the shrimp as they swam, so the researchers kept the shrimp away from the edges of the tank by shining the<>          5  green laser beam directly down into the center. To help visualize the swirls and eddies generated by the shrimp, the researchers added<>             copious amounts of silver-coated microspheres to the water and illuminated them with a red laser, a color that doesn’t seem to affect the<>             shrimps’ behavior.<>                  The team’s high-speed videos of the teeming, laser-lit migrations captured images of swirls much larger than the creatures<>             themselves, which resulted from the interactions of smaller ows created by individuals. The larger the swirls, the more effective the<>         10  mixing might be, Dabiri says. “So even for slow migrations, there could be strong effects,” he notes.<>                  Previous studies suggest that light-harvesting phytoplankton, the base of the ocean’s food chain, collect about 60 terawatt-hours of<>             solar energy, Dabiri says. Even if marine organisms that consume phytoplankton convert only 1% of that power into mixing the oceans,<>             that’s collectively comparable to the mixing power of winds and tides, Dabiri and Wilhelmus report.<>                  “This is a really innovative experimental setup that provides a nice illustration of ow velocities,” says Christian Noss, a uid<>         15  dynamicist at the University of Koblenz-Landau.

And subsequently, experiments similar to Dabiri’s suggested that strati cation sti es mixing. In<>             that research, Noss and colleague Andreas Lorke, also of Koblenz-Landau, studied the effects of large crowds of aquatic creatures called<>             Daphnia (commonly known as water eas) as they migrated up and down in a tank of mildly strati ed water. As expected, the<>         25  strati cation squelched the biomixing generated by the swimming Daphnia, Noss says. Those results aren’t surprising, Visser says. “It’s<>             dif cult to lift heavy water up and to push light water down.”<>                  Dabiri and his colleagues’ next set of lab experiments will look at the effects of sea monkey migrations in strati ed waters, he says.<>             Those experiments should reveal whether sea monkeys are better mixers than water eas.<><>|      According to the passage, Monismith is not convinced that Dabiri and Wilhelmus’s results can be|     A. generalized to the natural environment.<>     B. replicated under the same conditions.<>     C. veri ed by other researchers.<>     D. reconciled with earlier ndings.<>|Choice A is the best answer.

            Questions 22-31 are based on the following passage.<>            This passage is adapted from Patricia Waldron, “Why Birds Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for the<>            Advancement of Science.<>       Line        Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds y in a V formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new<>                study of ibises nds that these big-winged birds carefully position their wingtips and sync their apping, presumably to catch the<>                preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy during ight.<>                   There are two reasons birds might y in a V formation: It may make ight easier, or they’re simply following the leader. Squadrons of<>          5     planes can save fuel by ying in a V formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated<>                  apping birds like xed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting off each other, but currents created by airplanes are<>                far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a apping wing,” says James<>                Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the University of London in Hat eld, where the research took<>                place.<>         10        The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus<>                eremita) to Europe. Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A<>                  ock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device’s GPS determined each bird’s ight<>                position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing aps.<>                   Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to y just behind and to the side of the bird in front,<>         15     timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird ew directly behind another, the timing of the apping reversed so<>                that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body. “We didn’t think this was possible,”<>                Usherwood says, considering that the feat requires careful ight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors. “Perhaps these big V<>                formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down.”<>                   The ndings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more<>         20     complex wakes that would make drafting too dif cult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings because<>                the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can<>                use 20 percent to 30 percent less energy while ying in a V.<>                   “From a behavioral perspective it’s really a breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo<>                Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. “Showing that birds care about syncing their wing beats is de nitely an important<>         25     insight that we didn’t have before.”<>                   Scientists do not know how the birds nd that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either<>                by sight or by sensing air currents through their feathers. Alternatively, they may move around until they nd the location with the<>                least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to<>                investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through<>         30     the rest of the ock to cause traf c jams.<>                   “It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,” says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the<>                University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies ight aerodynamics in birds and insects.

You pass through long stretches of country<>             without counting anything. When you do see houses, they’re clustered into towns, and may have spacious yards with tire swings. As you<>             approach a city ( nally!), rows of houses appear at regular intervals instead of clumping. And in the heart of the city they shrink into little<>             apartments that go by too fast for you to count. European rabbits, it turns out, build their homes in a similar way—and since these animals<>          5  are disappearing in the countryside, understanding their urban planning strategy matters to humans trying to conserve them.<>                 Hunting, habitat loss, and disease have driven down populations of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in the countrysides of<>             western Europe. Yet rabbit populations in some German cities are, well, hopping. Madlen Ziege, a graduate student at the University of<>             Frankfurt, and her coauthors wanted to know how rabbits are taking advantage of urban areas. They chose the city of Frankfurt, where<>             European rabbits have lived alongside humans since at least 1930.<>         10      The researchers scoured nine city parks in Frankfurt for rabbit burrows, along with four more suburban parks and three nearby rural<>             sites. In all, they found 191 burrows. Then they rated each site for its “urbanity,” a measure that included three variables: How many people<>             live within half a kilometer of the burrow site? How many pedestrians, bikers, or dogs pass by at dawn and dusk, when rabbits are most<>             active? And how much of the ground is covered by something arti cial, such as pavement or playground turf?<>                 Like census-takers, albeit with a serious language barrier, the researchers tried to count how many rabbits lived in each burrow. For a<>         15  few dozen burrows, they did this by tagging along with a regular hunting group that ushed the rabbits from their holes with trained<>             ferrets. At other sites, the researchers staked out burrows at dawn and dusk and tallied how many rabbits came and went. They also<>             counted burrow entrances to estimate how big each home was.<>                 As “urbanity” increased—as sites became less rural and more city-like—rabbit burrows became more common. Urban burrows were<>             smaller and simpler, like studio apartments compared to country estates. And while rural burrows were spread out and clumped, like the<>         20  rural houses on our imaginary road trip, urban burrows were spaced out more evenly.<>                 Ziege writes that the results could easily have been the opposite. Since cities cover up more ground with pavement and buildings,<>             breaking potential habitat into fragments, city rabbits might end up clustered into big burrows like they do in the countryside. Instead,<>             they’re spread out into small homes.<>                 One reason might be heat. Big groups of rabbits keep their burrows toastier in the winter—but cities are a little warmer to begin with, so<>         25  living with a lot of warm bodies might not be as important. In the countryside, large burrows with many entrances and escape routes also<>             help protect rabbits from predators. But in the city, there are fewer predators.<>                 Finally, rabbits tend to live in large groups when their resources are limited. In German cities, they may be spreading out because<>             there’s no shortage of food or burrowing space. Country life may mean hunger and hunting ferrets, but for urban rabbits, life is (so far)<>             good.<>             Figure 1<>             Figure 2<><>|         Figures adapted from M. Ziege et al., “From Multifamily Residences to Studio Apartments: Shifts in Burrow Structures of European Rabbits|     along a Rural-to-Urban Gradient.” ©2015 by The Zoological Society of London.<>         Fewer than 69 distinct data points appear in figure 2 because certain points share identical values and thus occupy the same position in<>     the figure.<>       Based on the passage, which inverse relationship is demonstrated by the burrowing patterns of European rabbits?<>|      B. A burrow’s design tends toward greater complexity as the predation threat faced by the burrow lessens.<>      C. An abundance of food in a given area correlates with a low average population per burrow.<>      D. Widespread availability of uncovered ground in uences rabbits to limit the size of their burrows.<>Rationale<>Choice C is the best answer. According to the last paragraph, “rabbits tend to live in large groups when their resources are limited.<>In German cities, they may be spreading out because there’s no shortage of food or burrowing space.” Thus, based on the passage,<>the burrowing patterns of European rabbits demonstrate the inverse relationship of an abundance of food in a given area<>correlating with a low average population per burrow.<>Choice A is incorrect because the passage doesn’t discuss the genetic diversity of rabbits in relation to burrow size. Choice B is<>incorrect because the passage suggests that the complexity of a burrow’s design increases as the threat of predation grows, not as<>it lessens. Choice D is incorrect because the researchers found that rabbits were more likely to limit the size of their burrows in<>cities where uncovered ground was less, not more, available than it was in rural areas.<>|Question Difficulty: Hard
